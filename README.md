. In this beautiful project course name, description, pricing, credit hour are displayed in each card and also toast notification is added if the condition match.


How I managed state declaration in this project:
In this project i have declared five state. They are:
.  One for adding card in the UI
.  One for course title
.  One for Total credit hour
.  One for remaining credit and
.  last one for total price.
For each state declaration I have added event handler individually, the set these event handler in one function then this one function I called in the onClick in the Select buton.
